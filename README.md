# Life-Expectancy-Analysis
Utilised PowerBI to analyse the world population data set on Life expectancy.

Introduction : 
This Project is based on a dataset provided by WHO and United Nations website to determine and analyze the predicting factors that contribute to a higher or lower value of life expectancy for different countries.  


Project description: 
The dataset consisted of  22 columns and 2,938 rows with 20 predicting variables.These predicting variables included Immunization related factors , Mortality factors, Economical factors, Social and other Health related factors.The data collected spanned a 15 year period starting from year 2000 to year 2015. Also, the  data was taken from 193 countries which were grouped into Developed and Developing Countries. After loading the data into Power BI desktop, certain questions were derived from the predicting variables which had the potential to help us achieve our goal. 

These questions were: 

How does Schooling  affect Life expectancy?
Does adult mortality rate have an impact on life expectancy?
Does life expectancy have positive or negative correlation with certain lifestyles such as     drinking of alcohol? 
What impact does Immunization against Diphtheria and Polio have on life expectancy?
What are the effects of  HIV/AIDS on life expectancy?
Should countries below the Average life expectancy increase their Healthcare expenditure in order to improve their  average lifespan?


RECOMMENDATIONS : 

  Key insights: In developed countries,we realized there was a higher schooling rate, and their higher economic  values showed a positive relationship with their healthcare needs.  Hence we assume that they  invested their economic returns into these areas.

Therefore, if developing countries having higher  mortality rates, higher infant deaths, lower life expectancy values should tailor their resources to their health sector then their life expectancy is expected to increase overtime.
